# Welcome to Proman MMXIII

## About this project

__Proman__ is a web application designed to help with the management of undergraduate dissertation projects.
It is designed to help with the gathering of project descriptions from academic staff, student selection of projects
from the annually published list, allocation of projects to students, and the ongoing management of undergraduate
dissertation projects through the academic year. It was created by Nicolay Parashkevanov, a student of Mobile
Communications and Internet Technology at Swansea University. __Proman__ is a Ruby on Rails application and was
launched as a "beta" web application in late May 2009. Proman MMXII is the third generation of this application,
rebuilt from the ground up to exploit the latest innovations in modern Rails application development and to correct
some of the major deficiencies of the first deployed version [Proman 2](http://github.com/cpjobling/Proman2).

The source code for the Proman project is licensed by an Apache 2 licence and hosted on
[githib.com](http://github.com/cpjobling/Proman-3). There is a Google Groups discussion group:
[swansea-proman-discuss@googlegroups.com](http://groups.google.com/group/swansea-proman-discuss)
and a [project blog](http://promanman.blogspot.com/).
